My Advent of Code 2023 solutions, written in Go

## DISCLAIMER

My Go is a bit rusty (no, that's not a pun or a reference to :crab: lang) because I don't get to use it as
much as I'd like to. I'm making an effort here to refresh my memory and re-learn the best practices. I'm doing
that as I go (ok, that was a pun) and don't really want to revisit the past days just to refactor things so
that I can see how much progress I can make in a month. So please excuse the mess in the first days. And while
I try to make everything cleaner the further I get, sometimes just getting the thing done might override my
desire on making everything Shiny:tm:. At the end of the day, this isn't meant to be production ready.
